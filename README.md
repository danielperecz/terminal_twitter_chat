# Terminal Twitter Chat [WIP]
## Goal
Be able to chat with anyone via a terminal on any Operating System.

## How it works
### So far:
The class `TerminalTwitterChat` reads user information from `accounts.txt` and its `__init__` method initialises a Twitter `Api` object using this information.

### What's next:
Using the `Api` object I will implement the Direct Message feature - assuming my Twitter developer application gets approved.
